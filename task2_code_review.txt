#1 Please follow proper casing of HTML tags, use lowercase for all html tags

#2 Please use camel case for variable names [getinfo.php, L4-L5]
$ArrayURL = split('/', $_SERVER[REQUEST_URI]));

#3 Please use comparison operator [getinfo.php, L8] 
if (is_object($data) = true) $status = '200 OK';

#4 Either use curly braces for if condition or use [getinfo.php, L8]
$status = (is_object($data) == true) ? '200 OK' : '';

#5 This will throw a fatal error, class name not found. Since there is no class named as dataObj instead it should be propertyData / hdbData / condoData
$data = new dataObj();

#6 This will throw an exception, or give null value always [getinfo.php, L12]
return json_encode( $data->getAll($id) );

Because the value stored in $id is $_SERVER[REQUEST_URI] which is a string, and getAll($id) compared ID column from the table which is INT.

#7 And calling json_encode($data->getAll($id)); function without initializing $table will give an error $table undefined.

#8 In data.php, instead of setting $table as private it should be set as protected so that the values can be set by the child inherited class.
private $table = null;

#9 For the databases, please follow either on of the DB engines please change MyISAM to InnoDB

#10 Change the function name "gotSwimmingPool" to "isSwimmingPool" 

#11 In SQL, HDB block should be varchar instead of INT
